# Sports
Sports app consists of two screens. The first screen displays the sports list. The user can select a particular sport item and the second screen is displayed. The second screen is a details screen that displays the selected sports news. The details screen displays placeholder text to simplify implementation.

(Built this app to learn how to make apps adaptable to different screen sizes (using _Adaptive layouts_))
